# Airdrop Calendar Generator
This project generates an ICS calendar file containing cryptocurrency airdrop events for 2024. It is designed to be collaborative, allowing community members to contribute with new events and updates.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed on your system.

### Installing Python
If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

### Installing `ics` Library
Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS and Linux) and run the following command:

```bash
pip install ics

## Usage
Clone the repository or download the generate_calendar.py script.
Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the script.
Run the script using Python:

```bash
python generate_calendar.py

The script will generate an Airdrop_Calendar.ics file in the same directory.

Import the generated Airdrop_Calendar.ics file into your calendar application.

### Importing the Calendar into Apple iPhone

#### Method 1: Via Outlook Email
Send an Email: Attach the generated .ics file and send it to an email address accessible on your iPhone.
Open Email: Open the email on your iPhone and download the .ics file attachment.
Import Events: Tap on the attachment to open it, which usually brings up an option to add all events to your calendar.

#### Method 2: Via iCloud
Log in to iCloud.com: Use a computer to go to iCloud.com and sign in with your Apple ID.
Open Calendar: Click on the Calendar icon.
Import Events: Click the settings icon (gear-shaped) at the bottom left, choose "Import File," and select your .ics file.

#### Method 3: Via AirDrop

### Troubleshooting iPhone Import Issues
If you encounter issues importing the calendar on your iPhone, try the following:
Ensure Mail App Access to Calendar
Go to "Settings" > "Mail" > "Accounts" and make sure "Calendars" is enabled for your email account.
Use a Different Mail Client
If you're using the iOS Mail app, try a different email client like Gmail or Outlook to open the .ics file.
Manually Add Events to Calendar
Open the email with the .ics file in the Mail app, tap on the attachment, and look for an "Add" button or similar option to save events to the calendar.
Restart Your Device
Sometimes a simple restart can fix temporary software issues. Press and quickly release the volume up and down buttons, then press and hold the side button until the Apple logo appears.
Check Calendar Settings
Go to "Settings" > "Calendar" to ensure you have a default calendar selected and that your calendar account is enabled.
Use File Sharing Services
Alternatively, use iCloud Drive, Dropbox, or other file-sharing services to upload the .ics file, then access and open it on your iPhone, which might trigger the option to add it to the calendar.
